= "Create Project" Endpoint Review
:author: Alexey Bogdanov

== What’s Missing

=== {counter:sec-1}. Missing Response Schema

The documentation does not include the full success response body schema — for example, what fields are returned when a project is successfully created (e.g., project metadata, IDs, timestamps).

Developers may need to know the exact response structure for API integration, error handling, etc.

A full response JSON example can be added after the `Create Project` request example.


=== {counter:sec-1}. Missing Error Cases

The current description doesn’t list potential errors or status codes.

It will help developers build robust error handling, especially for automated tools and SDKs.

It can be added at the end of the section.

=== {counter:sec-1}. Missing details about `project_type`

It stays unclear how a user should choose a value for `project_type` parameter.


== Issues in Existing Content

=== Unclear Authentication Context

The current documentation shows a curl with Authorization: `Bearer <your-bearer-token>` but doesn’t explain how to obtain the token.

== Improvement Suggestions

=== {counter:sec-3}. Add a Table for Properties Descriptions

A table may look like this:

[cols="2,1,3,3"]
|===
|*Property* |*Required* |*Description* | *Naming*

|`project_name`
|Yes
|Unique identifier for your project.
|1-63 characters (letters, numbers, _, -).

|`project_type`
|Yes
|Type of project. <and how to choose it>
|e.g., "graphrag"

|`project_db_name`
|Yes
|The ArangoDB database name where the project will be created.
|

|`project_description`
|No
|A description of your project.
|
|===

=== {counter:sec-3}. Add a “Best Practices” or “Tips” Section

This section may include:

* Recommended naming conventions
* How to choose `project_type` values
* Some real examples

This would make the API easier to adopt and integrate.
