This decision guide helps you choose between the different *named graph types* in ArangoDB based on your scale, performance, and complexity requirements.

== Overview of Graph Types

* {general-graphs} -- basic graph structure, easy to set up
* {smart-graphs} -- optimized for high performance and large clusters
* {enterprise-graphs} -- enterprise-level graph with automated sharding
* {satellite-graphs} -- fully replicated graph for maximum locality

| Graph Type | When to Use | Best For | Trade-offs

| *General Graphs*
| Use when you need a simple graph with no special sharding or performance concerns.
| ✓ Small datasets
| *Pros*: Easiest to set up, no special config.

*Cons*: Random data distribution can hurt query performance at scale.

| *SmartGraphs*
| Use when your graph is large or highly interconnected and you have an attribute that groups nodes naturally.
| ✓ Large datasets +
✓ Cluster deployments
| *Pros*: Value-based sharding improves data locality and reduces network hops for traversals.

*Cons*: Requires a `smartGraphAttribute` -- not ideal if no clustering property exists.

| *EnterpriseGraphs*
| Use when you need enterprise-grade scalability without manually choosing a sharding attribute.
| ✓ Large cluster workloads
| *Pros*: Randomized sharding that co-locates adjacent edges and nodes, reducing network hops without a `smartGraphAttribute`.

*Cons*: Slightly more complex setup than SmartGraphs; still not replicated like SatelliteGraphs.

| *SatelliteGraphs*
| Use when your graph can fit on each server and you need maximum local performance for traversals.
| ✓ Large and read-heavy workloads
| *Pros*: Full replication to all DB-Servers eliminates network hops for traversals.

*Cons*: The graph data must fit on each node, therefore it will typically be a small to medium sized graph. Writes are slower due to replication.
